    "beta": "This is a route that tests finger strength and explosive power. After starting, you need to handle several small crimps in a row, then make a small dynamic move from hold #29 to grab #22. The key is to stabilize the body before launching, using leg power to push precisely, rather than just pulling with the arms. This is great for training her ability to release power in a controlled manner.",
